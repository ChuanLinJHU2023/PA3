MainPDF.pdf provides all the relevant information about the assignment. It is the first file to view.
main.py implements the quicksort and quicksort using median of the three partition. This program is the core of other programs.

TraceRun1.py is the first trace run to show the correctness of quicksort using median of the three partition
TraceRun2.py is the second trace run to show the correctness of quicksort using median of the three partition
TraceRun1_Output is the output of TraceRun1.py, showing the correctness of quicksort using median of the three partition
TraceRun2_Output is the output of TraceRun2.py, showing the correctness of quicksort using median of the three partition

TestRunForQuickSort.py is the test run to measure the asymptotic behavior of quicksort
TestRunForQuickSortM3.py is the test run to measure the asymptotic behavior of quicksort using median of the three partition
TestRunForQuickSort_Output is the output of TestRunForQuickSort, measuring the asymptotic behavior of quicksort
TestRunForQuickSortM3_Output is the output of TestRunForQuickSortM3, measuring the asymptotic behavior of quicksort using median of the three partition

ComparisonForQuickSortM3.py draws the graph to compare algorithm’s worst-case asymptotic behavior to the achieved asymptotic behavior of the program
ComparisonForQuickSortM3_Output is the output of ComparisonForQuickSortM3.py, comparing algorithm’s worst-case asymptotic behavior to the achieved asymptotic behavior of the program

WorstCaseBuilder.py provides the method to build the worst case for quicksort and the worst case for quicksort using median of three partition
WorstCaseBuilder_Example provides an example of the worst case for quicksort using median of the three. This example is built by WorstCaseBuilder.py

tools.py provides some simple math functions for other programs.

The compiler is python 3.11
The IDE is Pycharm
For every py file, the instruction to run it is "python xxx.py", where xxx.py is the name of the file that you want to run.
